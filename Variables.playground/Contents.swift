// Swift works with Value Types for struct, unlike Reference Type in Dart
// When a pre-asigned variabled is asigned to some another varible, copy of older variable
// is actually being assigned instead of the reference (as in Dart)

// Note: class -> Referential type

// This is a old Obj-C class, through which even if the variable type is "let"
// Internal impl. of list can be mutated

// Value would reflect in [oldStyledArray] as well
